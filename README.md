CRUD in Django - python

A django blog showing how to post content, list, detail and delete As an deeply rooted C# developer,

and good performance. However, C# is more clear and organized, and itâ€™s much faster at runtime. 
While Python is easier to learn and write than C# and has vast standard libraries.
